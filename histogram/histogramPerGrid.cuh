 * histogramPerGrid.cuh
 *
 * Implementation of histogram that uses one global atomic per pixel.
 * This results in very data-dependent performance, as the hardware
 * facilities for mutual exclusion contend when trying to increment
 * the same histogram value concurrently.
 *
 * Requires: SM 1.1, for global atomics.
 *
 * Build with:
 *    nvcc -I ..\chLib --gpu-architecture sm_xx histogram.cu ..\chLib\pgm.cu -lnpp
