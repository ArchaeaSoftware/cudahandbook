 * histogramPerBlockReduce.cuh
 *
 * Implementation of histogram that uses one shared atomic per pixel,
 * then writes the shared histogram to a temporary buffer that is
 * then reduced to the output histogram by a subsequent kernel launch.
 * This method is reminiscent of early methods of doing Scan in CUDA.
 *
 * Requires: SM 1.2, for shared atomics.
