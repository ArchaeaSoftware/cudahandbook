 * histogramPerThread4x64.cuh
 *
 * Implementation of histogram that uses 8-bit privatized counters
 * and uses 32-bit increments to process them.
 * This version is the same as histogramPerThread64.cuh,
 * but unrolls the inner loop 4x.  That requires the number of blocks
 * to be adjusted upward, accordingly, to keep the counters from
 * rolling over.
 *
 * Requires: SM 1.2, for shared atomics.
